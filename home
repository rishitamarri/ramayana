Ramayana is one of the two major Sanskrit epics of ancient India, 
the other being the Mahābhārata. Along with the Mahābhārata, it forms the Hindu Itihasa.
The epic, traditionally ascribed to the Maharishi Valmiki, narrates the life of Rama, 
prince of the legendary kingdom of Kosala. The story follows his fourteen-year exile 
to the forest urged by his father King Dasharatha, on the request of Rama's stepmother 
Kaikeyi; his travels across forests in Bharath with his wife Sita and brother 
Lakshmana, the kidnapping of Sita by Ravana -the king of Lanka, that resulted in war; 
and Rama's eventual return to Ayodhya to be crowned king amidst jubilation and celebration.
There have been many attempts to unravel the epic's historical growth and 
compositional layers; various recent scholars' estimates for the earliest stage of the
 text range from the 7th to 4th centuries BCE with later stages extending up to the 3rd century CE.
The Ramayana is one of the largest ancient epics in world literature. It consists of 
nearly 24,000 verses (mostly set in the Shloka/Anustubh meter), divided into five 
kāṇḍas: the ayodhyakāṇḍa, the araṇyakāṇḍa, the kiṣkindakāṇḍa, the sundarākāṇḍa, and 
the laṅkākāṇḍa. and about 500 sargas (chapters).The uttarākāṇḍa,the bālakāṇḍa, 
although frequently counted among the main ones, is not a part of the original epic. 
Though Balakanda is sometimes considered in the main epic, according to many 
Uttarakanda is certainly a later interpolation and thus is not attributed to the work 
of Maharshi Valmiki. In Hindu tradition, the Ramayana is considered to be the 
Adi-kavya (first poem). It depicts the duties of relationships, portraying ideal 
characters like the ideal father, the ideal servant, the ideal brother, the ideal 
husband and the ideal king. The Ramayana was an important influence on later Sanskrit 
poetry and Hindu life and culture. Its most important moral influence was the 
importance of virtue, in the life of a citizen and in the ideals of the formation of a 
state or of a functioning society.
